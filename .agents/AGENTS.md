# Project Conventions & Rules (from CLAUDE.md)

Rules that apply to this repository.

## Frontend

### Clickable things show a pointer cursor

Anything a user can click, tap or activate uses `cursor: pointer` — buttons, dropdowns (`<select>`), nav items, cards that navigate, chips, tabs, custom controls built from `<div role="button">`. Disabled controls use `cursor: not-allowed`.

This is handled **once** in `@layer base` in `frontend/app/globals.css`, not per component. It covers native controls (`button`, `select`, `summary`, `a[href]`, `label[for]`) and the interactive ARIA roles — `button`, `link`, `tab`, `option`, `checkbox`, `switch`.

So: **a clickable `<div>` gets `role="button"`, not a `cursor-pointer` utility.** It needs the role for keyboard and screen-reader users anyway, and the cursor then follows for free. If something has the wrong cursor, the base rule is missing a selector — fix it there.

The one legitimate use of the utility is a cursor that depends on STATE rather than on what the element is, e.g. a row that is only clickable once its document has finished indexing (`library/page.tsx`). A few older call sites still carry a redundant `cursor-pointer` next to a role the base rule already covers; harmless, and not worth a sweep.

**Why the rule exists:** Tailwind v4 removed the `button { cursor: pointer }` reset that v3 shipped, so a bare `<button>` gets the arrow cursor. Every component class here had been restoring it by hand, which worked until something was built from `.md-state` plus utilities alone — the app switcher and the clarify options both shipped with the wrong cursor, and neither looked broken in a screenshot.

### Material 3

The UI is Material 3. Reuse what is in `frontend/app/md.tsx` (`Button`, `Dialog`, `TextArea`, `Chip`, `Ripplable`, …) and the `--md-*` tokens in `globals.css` rather than writing new one-off styles. Colour roles come in pairs — use `--md-on-x` with `--md-x` so contrast holds in every theme.

### One stack, several apps

Apps are registered in `frontend/app/projects.ts`. Adding one is a single entry there plus its pages; the drawer, the app switcher and active-item highlighting all read from it. Do not hardcode nav items anywhere else.

Three today — **Research Desk** (chat, library, lab, atlas), **Model Lab** (playground, transcribe) and **Parley** (speak, interview).

Parley has THREE MODES and they are one pipeline. Speak answers questions from the corpus; Interview profiles the participant against a fixed field list; Howler profiles them against a list GENERATED from a brief. The socket, audio handling, manual turn boundaries, tools, persistence and resumption are shared — the only difference is the system prompt (`live_prompts.py`) and the `kind` the conversation is stored under. Adding a mode should be an entry in `live.MODES` plus a route, and nothing else. If it needs more than that, something that ought to be shared has been duplicated.

Howler's schema is generated ONCE from the brief and frozen on the session (`blueprint.py`). Never regenerate it at connect time or per turn: completeness needs a fixed denominator, the tool declaration is fixed in the setup message, a resumed session must find the same shape, and a column that comes and goes between renders is not a profile. Anything the schema did not anticipate is still captured, as an `other` note -- that escape hatch is what makes freezing it safe.

Parley is a different DOOR onto the same corpus, not a second assistant. A document uploaded in the Library is answerable out loud the moment it finishes indexing. If you find yourself adding a second index for it, that is the mistake.

It is **audio to audio**, over a WebSocket to a native audio model — the audio is tokenised into the same sequence the model generates from, with no transcript in the middle. It does NOT use the LangGraph agent; the live model decides for itself when to search. What it shares is the TOOLS: `live.py` builds its declarations from `agent_tools.tool_specs()` and executes them through `agent_tools.run_tool`, so a tool description improved for the typed agent improves here too.

The cascade it replaced (`POST /voice/ask`: transcribe, run the graph, synthesise) is deliberately kept. It is a working reference implementation of the other architecture, and the measured difference is the most instructive thing in this repo — 12-53s to the first sound versus about 3s.

Two things about Live that fail SILENTLY, both pinned by tests:
- A turn does not end without **trailing silence**. Live decides the speaker stopped by hearing them stop; `audio_stream_end` does not substitute. Without it the model accepts the audio and never replies, with no error anywhere.
- `session.receive()` **ends at a tool call**. The spoken answer arrives on the next generator, so treating the first end as the end of the turn yields a tool call and zero audio.

### Adding a frontend dependency needs an image rebuild

`docker-compose.yml` mounts only `frontend/app` and `frontend/lib`. `package.json` and `node_modules` live **inside** the `web` image, so an `npm install` on the host never reaches the running container — the dev server keeps resolving against the image it was built from and reports `Module not found`.

```powershell
npm install <pkg>          # updates package.json + lockfile on the host
docker compose build web   # the step that actually installs it
docker compose up -d web
```

Deployed builds are unaffected: they build the image from the committed `package.json`, so the dependency is present.

## Backend

- Every DB query that touches user data is scoped by `owner_id`, passed explicitly rather than read from a context var. Aggregates especially: a count that quietly includes another tenant's rows still looks plausible.
- Secrets stay server-side. The frontend calls our API; our API calls the provider.
- Tool results that are not retrieved passages are not citable. See `corpus_facts` in `backend/app/agent/state.py`.

## Working style

- `docker compose restart` does **not** re-read `.env`. Use `docker compose up -d --force-recreate <service>`. **Docker Desktop's restart button is the same trap** — it reuses the existing container, so an edited `.env` is silently ignored.

  This one is worth checking rather than remembering, because it fails quietly: `GET /health` reports `storage_backend` and `storage_bucket`, so a container still running yesterday's configuration is one request away from being obvious.
- Never commit or push unless asked in that message.
